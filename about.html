              <p style="text-align:justify;">Hi There!, my name is Md. Sayed Sadman Sakib and I am currently a student at HSTU, pursuing a B.Sc. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I come from the small town of Panchpir Bazar in Boda, Panchagarh, Rangpur, where I was raised in a loving and supportive family environment.<br><br>

              Growing up, I have always been fascinated by technology and the wonders it can bring to our lives. This sparked my interest in the field of electronics and communications, leading me to choose this as my major in university. Studying at HSTU has been an incredible experience for me so far, as I get to learn from some of the best minds in the industry and gain hands-on experience through various projects and lab sessions<br><br>

              My family has always been my biggest support system, and I am proud to come from a family of hardworking individuals. My father is a farmer, and I have seen first hand the dedication and effort he puts into his work every day. On the other hand, my mother is a homemaker, who has always made sure that the home is a warm and welcoming place for all of us. I have two brothers, and I am the middle one. My elder brother has completed his MSc. in Mathematics, which I find truly inspiring. My younger brother is currently in Class 10, and I am proud to see him grow into a bright young man.<br><br>
              Aside from my academic pursuits, I have a deep love for movies and traveling. There is something truly special about immersing oneself in new cultures and experiencing different ways of life. For me, movies serve as a great source of entertainment and a way to escape the stresses of everyday life. I find it fascinating how films can bring people together, regardless of their background or differences.<br><br>
